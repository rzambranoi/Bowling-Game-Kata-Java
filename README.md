# The Bowling Kata

He describes the kata intention as:

> A kata is meant to be memorized. Students of a kata study it as a form, not as a conclusion. It is not the conclusion of the kata that matters, it's the steps that lead to the conclusion. If you want to lean to think the way I think, to design the way I design, then you must learn to react to minutia the way I react. Following this form will help you to do that. As you learn the form, and repeat it, and repeat it, you will condition your mind and body to respond the way I respond to the minute factors that lead to design decisions.  
> — Robert C. Martin

It contrasts with other katas that you might know. It is not an exercise of the resolution of a problem; it is the study of each step to create a solution.

## How to solve this Kata

Follow the Steps in [this presentation](./BowlingGameKata-Java.pdf).

The code is in a git repository. It starts in the «commit 0,» and it expects from you to replicate each slide in it. Be careful, and go slide by slide. Each time that you finish copying the changes of a slide verify two things: the commit number and the test bar status. If the test bar status matches the condition of your current tests, and there is a commit number, then commit the git repository with the commit number as a message. Once you have finished it, remember to push changes.
